**Abstract:** Quantum Computing has been evolving in the last years.  Although nowadays quantum algorithmsperformance has shown superior to their classical counterparts, quantum decoherence and additional auxiliaryqubits needed for error tolerance routines have been huge barriers for quantum algorithms efficient use. Theserestrictions lead us to search for ways to minimize algorithms costs, i.e the number of quantum logical gates andthe depth of the circuit. For this, quantum circuit synthesis and quantum circuit optimization techniques areexplored. We studied the viability of using Projective Simulation, a reinforcement learning technique, to tacklethe problem of quantum circuit synthesis for noise quantum computers with limited number of qubits. The agenthad the task of creating quantum circuits up to 5 qubits to generate GHZ states in the IBM Tenerife (IBM QX4)quantum processor. Our simulations demonstrated that the agent had a good performance but its capacity forlearning new circuits decreased as the number of qubits increased.
